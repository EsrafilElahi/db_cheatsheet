Candidate Key: The minimal set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple is known as a candidate key. For Example, STUD_NO in STUDENT relation. 
Example:  STUD_NO is the candidate key for relation STUDENT.
  
Primary Key : A primary key is used to ensure that data in the specific column is unique. A column cannot have NULL values. It is either an existing table column or a column that is specifically generated by the database according to a defined sequence. 
Example: STUD_NO, as well as STUD_PHONE both, are candidate keys for relation STUDENT but STUD_NO can be chosen as the primary key (only one out of many candidate keys). 

Super Key: The set of attributes that can uniquely identify a tuple is known as Super Key. For Example, STUD_NO, (STUD_NO, STUD_NAME), etc. A super key is a group of single or multiple keys that identifies rows in a table. It supports NULL values.
Example: STUD_NO+PHONE is a super key.

Alternate Key: The candidate key other than the primary key is called an alternate key.
Example: STUD_NO, as well as PHONE both, 
are candidate keys for relation STUDENT but 
PHONE will be an alternate key 
(only one out of many candidate keys).
  
Foreign Key : A foreign key is a column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between data in two tables. It is a column (or columns) that references a column (most often the primary key) of another table. 
Example: STUD_NO in STUDENT_COURSE is a foreign key to STUD_NO in STUDENT relation. 




one to one relation : city <---> state
one to many relation : 
  - customerID <---> order
  - customerID <---> payment
  - customerID <---> basket

many to many relation :
  1- studentID
                3- new table enrollment : {studentID, classID, enrollID}
  2- classID
