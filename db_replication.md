Data replication is the process of creating and maintaining multiple copies of data across different systems or storage locations. It is commonly used in distributed systems and databases to enhance data availability, fault tolerance, and performance. By replicating data, multiple copies of the same data are stored on different nodes or servers, allowing for redundancy and improving data access and reliability.
