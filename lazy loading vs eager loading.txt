Choosing Between Lazy Loading and Eager Loading:

Use Lazy Loading When:
  You have a large dataset, and not all related entities are always needed.
  You want to minimize the initial data load and fetch related entities only when required.
  
Use Eager Loading When:
  You frequently need the related entities along with the main entity.
  The cost of fetching related entities is not significant compared to the benefits of reduced subsequent queries.
