Data sharding is a technique used in database management systems to horizontally partition a large database into smaller, more manageable parts called shards. Each shard contains a subset of the data, and the shards are distributed across multiple servers or nodes. This approach can improve performance and scalability by allowing parallel processing and reducing the load on individual database servers.

* vertical sharding
* horizontal sharding

exmaple : we have big data users
shard_1 : asian customers --> separate server geographical locate
sahrd_2 : europian customers --> separate server geographical locate
shard_3 : american customers --> separate server geographical locate

Overall, data sharding improves the performance and scalability of the e-commerce system by distributing the data and workload across multiple servers, thereby enhancing responsiveness and accommodating the company's growth.
