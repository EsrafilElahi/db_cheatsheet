Database clustering, also known as database clustering or database cluster, is a technique used to provide high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance for database systems. It involves grouping multiple database servers together to function as a single logical unit. Clustering enables distributing the workload across multiple nodes, ensuring continuous availability, and accommodating increased system demands.
